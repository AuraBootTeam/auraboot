# OSS E2E Tasks

## Environment Status

- Worktree: `/Users/ghj/work/auraboot/auraboot`
- Branch: `main`
- Stack: local host OSS reset
- Ports: backend `6443`, frontend `5173`, BFF `3500`
- Status at 2026-05-22 CST: backend `/actuator/health` returned `200`, BFF `/health` returned `200`, and frontend `/` returned `302`.
- Playwright profile: `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1`
- Playwright base URL now defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5173` to avoid Node resolving `localhost` to IPv6 `::1` while Vite is reachable on IPv4.
- Note: the final full gate stayed healthy for the full run; the earlier `::1:5173` failure was classified as environment/baseURL invalid rather than a product failure.

## Latest Valid Full Run

- Full15 command:
  `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=oss --project=oss-deep --workers=1 --reporter=list`
- Full15 result: `1452 passed / 131 skipped / 0 failed`.
- Duration: about `1.4h`.
- Health during and after the run stayed valid: Vite `302`, BFF `200`, backend `200`.
- Previously fixed red points re-passed in the full sequence: automation `AUTO-05`, community `CM-07`, webhook `WH-002`, email compose `T5`, list empty-state `UES-001`, platform RBAC, smart-components money formatting, saved-view `CS-007/CS-008`, and dashboard `A3`.
- Post-run verification:
  - Backend unit: `./gradlew :test` passed.
  - Backend integration slices: `integrationTest testBpm testAgent testAi testPlugin` passed.
  - Frontend unit: `pnpm test:unit` passed.
  - TypeScript: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passed.
  - Lint: `pnpm lint` passed with existing warnings only (`0 errors`).
  - E2E truth self-check was run before completion was claimed; no new retry/threshold bypass was introduced in the changed specs.
- Interpretation: the current local host OSS full gate is green. The `131 skipped` entries are the suite's current skip/fixme baseline, not failures.

## Invalid/Aborted Runs

- OSS-scoped chromium single-worker attempt:
  `cd web-admin && ... PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.oss.config.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line --workers=1`
- Log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-chromium-w1-20260512-222533.log`
- Result: manually aborted after detecting it was an old leftover process still running during the fresh reset/auth/seed cycle.
- Reason invalid: this run overlapped with `docker-ga-e2e-down.sh --purge`, fresh stack creation, auth setup, and seed execution, so it cannot be used as an OSS product failure baseline.

- OSS-scoped chromium attempt:
  `cd web-admin && ... PW_WORKERS=4 pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.oss.config.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line`
- Log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-chromium-20260512-222000.log`
- Result: manually aborted at `66/1453` after `26` observed failures.
- Reason invalid: frontend service was CPU saturated (`~351%`) and `curl http://localhost:5174/` took `7.2s` while the run was active; after stopping Playwright, the same endpoint recovered to `0.66s`. Failures were dominated by navigation/click/table-readiness timeouts, so this run is environment/load noise, not a valid OSS product failure baseline.

## Latest Targeted Evidence

- Unified Designer Workbench V3 broader OSS no-deps repair pass (2026-05-21 CST):
  - Preflight: frontend `5237`, BFF `3564`, backend `6443` were listening; backend `/actuator/health` returned `{"status":"UP"}`.
  - Invalid command attempt: `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium --no-deps` failed before execution because `PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1` exposes role projects, not `chromium`; classified as command/profile invalid, not product failure.
  - Partial broader run command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line`
  - Partial broader run log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-chromium-nodeps-20260521-1044.log`.
  - Partial broader run result: manually stopped at `84/3574` after collecting valid early failures; this is not a full gate pass and not environment-invalid.
  - Observed valid failures and classification:
    - `DP-002/DP-003/DP-004` Data Permissions form showed title but no fields. Root cause: runtime still expected V2 top-level `form-section`, while runtime data can contain recursive V3-like `blockType=form` with nested blocks.
    - `PA-007` BPM Domain Config edit returned 422. Root cause: `ab_bpm_domain_config.*_fields` physical columns are JSONB while imported field metadata drifted to `text`, so command field mapping did not use `::jsonb`.
    - `ACT-001` Activity Timeline assertion could pick the newest `system` activity (`submit_order`) instead of the create activity. Root cause: test asserted the first system-like activity rather than existence of `create_order`.
  - Data Permissions fix: `canonicalizePageDsl` now normalizes recursive runtime root `form` blocks into current legacy form runtime sections/buttons without breaking plain V2 sections.
  - Data Permissions unit command: `cd web-admin && pnpm exec vitest run app/framework/meta/utils/__tests__/canonicalizePageDsl.test.ts`
  - Data Permissions unit result: `1 passed / 5 passed`.
  - Data Permissions targeted E2E command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/admin/data-permissions.spec.ts --project=chromium --grep "DP-002|DP-003|DP-004" --no-deps --reporter=line`
  - Data Permissions targeted E2E result: `3 passed`.
  - Platform Admin JSONB fix: `CommandFieldMapExecutor` now unions model-declared JSON/JSONB fields with physical PostgreSQL JSONB columns from `information_schema`; `FormPageContent` treats `jsonb` as JSON-like; `platform-admin` BPM domain config field source now marks `process_keys/list_fields/filter_fields/sort_fields` as `jsonb`.
  - Backend unit command: `cd platform && ./gradlew :test --tests com.auraboot.framework.meta.service.impl.CommandFieldMapExecutorReferencePidCompanionTest`
  - Backend unit result: `3 passed`.
  - Frontend unit command: `cd web-admin && pnpm exec vitest run app/framework/meta/rendering/pages/__tests__/FormPageContent.test.ts`
  - Frontend unit result: `12 passed`.
  - Runtime verification setup: OSS worktree core published to per-worktree Maven repo with `./gradlew -Dmaven.repo.local=/Users/ghj/work/auraboot/.worktrees/unified-designer-workbench-v3/.m2/repository publishToMavenLocal -x test`; 6443 was restarted from canonical enterprise with the same per-worktree repo, and classpath confirmed `auraboot-core` came from `.worktrees/unified-designer-workbench-v3/.m2/repository`.
  - Enterprise worktree boot attempt is environment-invalid for this pass: it failed before health due missing `StringRedisTemplate` bean in that worktree; canonical enterprise + per-worktree core was used to verify the OSS core fix without writing default `~/.m2`.
  - Platform Admin targeted E2E command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/admin/platform-admin-crud.spec.ts --project=chromium --grep "PA-007" --no-deps --reporter=line`
  - Platform Admin targeted E2E result: `1 passed`.
  - Activity Timeline fix: `ACT-001` now asserts that a `create_order` activity exists anywhere in the returned timeline instead of assuming the first system-like activity is the create event.
  - Activity targeted command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/activity/activity-timeline.spec.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line`
  - Activity targeted result: `5 passed`.
  - Fresh continuation rerun after the runtime repairs:
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 pnpm exec vitest run app/framework/meta/utils/__tests__/canonicalizePageDsl.test.ts app/framework/meta/rendering/pages/__tests__/FormPageContent.test.ts` -> `17 passed`.
    - `cd platform && ./gradlew :test --tests com.auraboot.framework.meta.service.impl.CommandFieldMapExecutorReferencePidCompanionTest` -> `3 passed`.
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 pnpm typecheck` -> passed.
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/admin/data-permissions.spec.ts --project=chromium --grep "DP-002|DP-003|DP-004" --no-deps --reporter=line` -> `3 passed`.
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/admin/platform-admin-crud.spec.ts --project=chromium --grep "PA-007" --no-deps --reporter=line` -> `1 passed`.
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/activity/activity-timeline.spec.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line` -> `5 passed`.
    - `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/designer/unified-designer-workbench.spec.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line` -> `61 passed`.
  - E2E truth continuation audit:
    - `unified-designer-workbench.spec.ts` contains `691` UI operation lines and `21` setup/helper `page.request` lines; the single `page.request.put` is named-query-field setup idempotency, not a product-path bypass.
    - `activity-timeline.spec.ts` is intentionally API-heavy for Activity API verification; the two `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2)` assertions are semantic lower bounds because setup creates at least the command activity plus a NOTE.
    - `test.skip/test.fixme/waitForTimeout/page.goto('/p/')/retries` scan for the audited specs returned no hits.
  - Broader full-sampling attempt after targeted repair:
    - Command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=fast PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium --no-deps --reporter=line`.
    - Log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-chromium-nodeps-full-rerun-20260521-1132.log`.
    - Result: manually stopped after valid failures were collected; the process exited via interrupt (`code -1`). It reached at least `361/3574`.
    - Scope correction: this was a broad `fast/chromium` file sweep and included enterprise distribution directories such as `annual-plan` and `asset-management`; it is not the documented OSS Platform Gate command.
    - Relevant positive signal: the run passed the previously failing `Data Permissions`, `Platform Admin JSONB`, and `Activity Timeline` segments before moving into unrelated suites.
    - Collected failures:
      - `acp-form-crud.spec.ts CRUD-25` failed during the broad sweep because the created artifact row was not found. A direct targeted rerun of `CRUD-25` passed (`1 passed`), so this is not currently a stable standalone reproduction.
      - `announcement-lifecycle.spec.ts archive and delete announcement` failed in the broad sweep because the test looked for English `delete` while the actual localized row action is `删除`. Running only that final test is invalid because it depends on prior file-local lifecycle setup; the whole-file targeted rerun is the valid reproduction shape.
      - `annual-plan` and `asset-management` failures reported `Command not found` for enterprise distribution commands (`ap:create_annual_plan`, `pm:create_project`, `asset:create`). These belong to enterprise distribution/import scope, not the Unified Designer feature-slice gate.
    - Gate profile follow-up: `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --list` and `PW_PROFILE=oss pnpm exec playwright test --list` initially listed only setup/auth-related `19` tests. `playwright.config.ts` has now been updated to implement the documented `oss/oss-deep`, `contract`, `enterprise-smoke`, and `enterprise-full` projects using directory boundaries from `e2e-scope-boundaries.md`.
    - Gate profile list verification after the config fix:
      - `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `1782` tests in `251` files.
      - `PW_PROFILE=contract pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `904` tests in `105` files.
      - `PW_PROFILE=enterprise-smoke pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `364` tests in `83` files.
      - `PW_PROFILE=enterprise-full pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `1357` tests in `136` files.
    - These are collection/gate-boundary checks only; they do not claim the listed gates have passed.
    - Correct-profile execution slices after the config fix:
      - `PW_PROFILE=contract PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=contract tests/e2e/action-system/action-types.spec.ts tests/e2e/activity/activity-timeline.spec.ts --reporter=line` -> `41 passed / 1 skipped`.
      - `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=oss tests/e2e/designer/unified-designer-workbench.spec.ts --reporter=line` -> `79 passed / 1 skipped`.
    - These prove the new gate projects execute with setup/auth dependencies and that Unified Designer passes under the documented OSS project. They still do not replace a full `PW_PROFILE=oss` run.
  - Fresh OSS full-gate attempt after profile correction:
    - Command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line`.
    - Log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-profile-full-20260521-continue.log`.
    - Result: stopped at `142/1782` on `announcement-lifecycle.spec.ts archive and delete announcement`; this is a real test failure, not environment-invalid.
    - Root cause: the test passed `delete` to `clickRowAction`, while the product UI and the rest of the same spec use localized labels (`发布`, `撤回`, `重新发布`, `删除`).
    - Fix: changed the final delete row action assertion to use `删除`.
    - Targeted rerun command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=oss tests/e2e/announcement/announcement-lifecycle.spec.ts --reporter=line`.
    - Targeted rerun result: `26 passed / 1 skipped`.
  - Fresh OSS full-gate attempt after the announcement fix:
    - Command: `cd web-admin && NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line`.
    - Log: `/tmp/oss-e2e-logs/oss-profile-full-r2-20260521.log`.
    - Result: announcement lifecycle passed in the full run; the next valid failures were `aurabot/pcba-*` specs at `228/1782`.
    - Failure class: scope-boundary bug, not product runtime failure. The specs require enterprise PCBA menus/plugins such as `PCBA ERP`, `product-catalog`, and `pcba-solution`, but they live under `tests/e2e/aurabot` instead of enterprise distribution directories.
    - Fix: added `enterpriseDistributionAuxSpecPattern` for `tests/e2e/aurabot/pcba-*.spec.ts`, excluded it from OSS/OSS-deep, and included it in `enterprise-smoke`/`enterprise-full`.
    - List audit after the scope fix:
      - `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `1776` tests in `247` files; grep for `aurabot/pcba`, `pcba-solution`, and `tests/e2e/pcba/` returned no hits.
      - `PW_PROFILE=contract pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `904` tests in `105` files.
      - `PW_PROFILE=enterprise-smoke pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `366` tests in `85` files, including `pcba-procurement-agent-entry` and `pcba-quality-agent-entry`.
      - `PW_PROFILE=enterprise-full pnpm exec playwright test --list` -> `1363` tests in `140` files, including all four `aurabot/pcba-*` specs.
  - Remaining gate status: localized announcement failure and PCBA auxiliary scope leakage are fixed and audited; a fresh controlled `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1` full rerun is still required before any new OSS full-gate completion claim.

## Fixed Failure Groups Covered By Full Rerun

- Designer cluster: fixed product i18n write (`form-section/detail-section` title now persisted as `LocalizedText`) and zh-CN selector assumptions (`Section Title`/`区段标题`, `Actions`/`操作`).
- OSS scope: excluded PCBA quality specs because they depend on enterprise quality/product-catalog plugins and Quality/CAPA pages absent from OSS.
- DB env drift: `tenant-isolation-ui.spec.ts` and `query-builder-basic.spec.ts` now use shared `PG_CONN`, honoring `PG_HOST/PG_PORT/PG_USER/PG_DB`.
- Default view assumptions: CRM/list tests now explicitly select `Default View` before asserting table rows.
- Timeout/sequencing: increased API helper timeouts where backend calls legitimately exceed Playwright's default 5s action timeout; permission D8 timeout now matches siblings.
- Environment page race: fixed premature empty-state rendering before auth/cookie-backed environment fetch completes.
- Environment delete cleanup: delete tests now explicitly accept the native confirm dialog and wait for the DELETE response; the page also removes the deleted environment from local state immediately after a successful response.
- BPM trace wait: fixed a click/response race in PD-013 by registering the response wait before clicking the All tab.
- Data tools deep export API: switched old nonexistent `GET /api/meta/excel/export/*` checks to current `POST /api/dynamic/{pageKey}/export` contract, preserving the existing OSS fixture rule that 403 permission denial is acceptable but 404/405/5xx is not.
- SavedView deep non-table view setup: Kanban/Calendar/Gallery persistence specs now create a temporary default table view before navigating so serial non-table defaults cannot hide table rows before the view under test is created.

## Known Invalid Failures

- Initial host Playwright run failed before collection because host dependencies were missing (`@playwright/test` not installed). Fixed by `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`.
- First container-run auth attempt failed with `ECONNREFUSED ::1:6443`; root cause: setup spec direct backend calls need `BACKEND_URL`, and frontend container is not the right psql-capable runner.
- First host auth attempt failed with `fe_sendauth: no password supplied`; root cause: missing `PGPASSWORD=auraboot_dev`.
- Bootstrap plugin imports for `agent-control-plane` and `platform-admin` report `Business error` on repeated import, but setup invariant 8 passes and auth succeeds. Treat as bootstrap idempotency noise unless a product spec later proves a missing capability.
- Raw regular `chromium` full run contains suites that require non-OSS plugins or command resources. These should be excluded from the OSS Docker gate instead of treated as product defects in the OSS stack.

## Next Action

- Unified Designer Workbench V3 next action:
  - Relation picker field authoring is now covered: backend model field `refTarget` is mapped into `ModelFieldDefinition`, relation/reference/lookup fields dropped from the model field palette become `component=picker` with model source/value/display/search defaults, browser test `UDW-053` verifies drag-to-form, Inspector configuration, local save, and reload, and `UDW-054` verifies drag-to-list-filter, V3 writeback, preview picker selection, and real table row filtering. Runtime unit coverage also verifies picker filter option loading and row filtering.
  - Field/filter/column block-level permission is now covered: Inspector exposes `props.permissionCode`; runtime gates form inputs, list filter controls, table headers, and table cells; browser test `UDW-055` verifies save/writeback and preview data gating.
  - Row action conditional behavior is now covered: Inspector exposes `props.visibleWhen` and `props.disabledWhen`; runtime evaluates rules against current row fields plus `current.row.*` / `current.rowId`; browser test `UDW-056` verifies V3 save/readback, disabled first-row action, and hidden second-row action.
  - Form action conditional behavior is now covered: browser test `UDW-057` configures action `visibleWhen/disabledWhen` from form values, verifies schema-driven Inspector JSON writeback, save/reload persistence, preview hidden/enabled/disabled states, and keeps `UDW-022` isolated by clearing inherited action conditions before validation testing.
  - Form field span quick controls are now covered at browser level: `UDW-058` changes a field from layout mode quick controls, saves, reloads, reads V3 back through `/api/pages/{pid}`, and asserts runtime preview grid style.
  - AI fill preview-time field backfill is now covered for both static Inspector suggestions and live namedQuery suggestions: `RuntimeAiFillBanner` writes `{ field, value }` suggestions into the current form context, `UDW-059` verifies static `props.suggestedFields`, and `UDW-060` verifies real `/api/meta/named-queries/{code}/execute` response values update the target form input.
  - Repeater/subform nested row validation is now covered: runtime validation now walks nested row containers, renders row-field errors, clears them when row values change, and `UDW-061` verifies action execution stays blocked until repeater and subform required fields are filled.
  - Keep expanding V3 runtime coverage toward production relation subform persistence and richer nested form validation; current `subform` evidence covers designer authoring, row editor preview, payload writeback, and persistence.
  - Product-integration gaps now sit outside generic workbench mechanics: real AI generation service, real BPM/timeline/field-history business queries, and backend-enforced data policy semantics beyond preview-time block conditions.
  - Before any completion claim for the whole Unified Designer effort, run `/e2e-truth` discipline against the final diff and then decide whether a broader OSS/enterprise gate is required beyond the workbench full-slice.

Existing 3 处 `toBeGreaterThan(0)` are data non-empty assertions, not threshold looseners.
- E2E truth audit completed:
  - No new `test.skip` / `test.fixme` / `retries` / `waitForTimeout`.
  - No new PUT-bypass helper (`request.put` / `page.request.put`) in the diff.
  - No new threshold assertion (`toBeLessThanOrEqual` / `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`) in the diff.
  - `git diff --check` exits 0.
- OSS scope list audit completed:
  - `chromium --list` contains `1451` tests and no `pcba` / `quality-agent` / `pcba-solution` / `qc_` matches.
  - `chromium-deep --list` contains `192` tests and no `pcba` / `quality-agent` / `pcba-solution` / `qc_` matches.

## Fresh OSS Profile Gate Continuation (2026-05-21)

在把 Playwright profile 从旧 `chromium/chromium-deep` 扩展为文档化的 `oss/oss-deep/contract/enterprise-smoke/enterprise-full` 后，继续推进真正的 OSS Platform Gate。

### 已修复的 gate 阻塞点

| 阻塞点 | 根因 | 修复 | 验证 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| `announcement-lifecycle.spec.ts archive and delete announcement` | 测试最后一步查找英文 `delete`，但真实产品行操作标签是中文 `删除` | 将该步骤改为 `clickRowAction(page, TITLE, '删除')` | 整文件 targeted rerun `26 passed / 1 skipped`；后续 full run 已越过 announcement |
| `aurabot/pcba-*` specs 进入 OSS gate | 这些 specs 放在 `tests/e2e/aurabot`，但依赖企业 PCBA/quality/product-catalog 插件；原 scope 只排除了企业目录 | 新增 `enterpriseDistributionAuxSpecPattern = /\/tests\/e2e\/aurabot\/pcba-.*\.spec\.ts$/`，OSS 排除，enterprise gate 纳入 | `PW_PROFILE=oss --list` 为 `1776` tests / `247` files，grep 无 `aurabot/pcba`、`pcba-solution`、`tests/e2e/pcba/` |
| `crm-batch-ops.spec.ts BATCH-002` | CRM lead list 页面未开启 table 多选，测试和批量操作 UX 需要表头 select-all | `crm_lead_table.table.selection.mode = multiple`，并重新导入 `crm-starter` 页面资源 | CRM targeted rerun `27 passed / 1 skipped` |
| `crm-calendar-sync.spec.ts cal-01` | `/crm/settings/calendar-sync` 菜单路径没有注册静态 route，落入 catch-all 后提示菜单“日历集成”没有 PageSchema 配置 | 在 core route manifest 注册 CRM 静态页面：merge queue、inbound channels、web forms、web-form editor、calendar-sync | `pnpm typecheck` 生成 route types；重启 5237/3564 后 CRM targeted rerun `27 passed / 1 skipped` |

### 当前有效验证证据

```bash
cd web-admin
pnpm typecheck
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=oss tests/e2e/announcement/announcement-lifecycle.spec.ts --reporter=line
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5237 PW_PROFILE=oss PW_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test --project=oss tests/e2e/crm/crm-batch-ops.spec.ts tests/e2e/crm/crm-calendar-sync.spec.ts --reporter=line
```

结果：

- `pnpm typecheck` passed。
- Announcement targeted：`26 passed / 1 skipped`。
- CRM targeted：`27 passed / 1 skipped`。

注意：calendar-sync 修复后，旧 dev server 仍走 stale route manifest，失败页为 `Page Unavailable`。使用如下命令重启 worktree 服务后 targeted 通过：

```bash
VITE_PORT=5237 BFF_PORT=3564 BFF_ALLOWED_PORTS=5237 SPRING_BOOT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6443 pnpm dev:full
```

### 当前结论

- Unified Designer feature slice 已有独立 targeted、unit、typecheck 与 E2E truth 证据。
- Fresh `PW_PROFILE=oss PW_ROLE_PROJECTS=1` full gate 已逐步清掉 announcement、PCBA scope、CRM batch/calendar-sync 阻塞。
- 仍未完成一轮全量 OSS profile 0 fail，因此不能声明 OSS Platform Gate 完整通过。
